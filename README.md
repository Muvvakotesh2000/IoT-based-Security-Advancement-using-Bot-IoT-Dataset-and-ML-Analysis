# Project Title: IoT Security Advancement using Bot-IoT Dataset and ML Analysis
## Project Overview
The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) systems in various IT sectors has made them prime targets for malicious activities. In response to the vulnerabilities and challenges associated with IoT systems, there is a critical need for the development of robust protective measures, including intrusion detection systems and network forensic systems. To effectively address these challenges, this project focuses on leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for security advancements.

The primary goal is to analyze different types of attacks utilizing the Bot-IoT dataset and to apply and compare various ML-based classification algorithms. The project involves the application of machine learning algorithms tested on the top ten features extracted from the dataset. The selection of these features is based on the paper titled **“Towards the development of realistic botnet dataset in the Internet of Things for network forensic analytics: Bot-IoT dataset”** which provides a detailed dataset description.

## Dataset
The Bot-IoT dataset is generated using the Ostinato Tool, a tool designed for generating realistic data with the assistance of a cloud server comprising Virtual Machines and Kali machines. The Kali machines deploy services such as DNS, SSH, FTP, HTTP, among others. The simulation of IoT devices is achieved through the Node-RED tool, with communication facilitated by the MQTT protocol.

The dataset collection involves the implementation of five distinct IoT scenarios within the cloud server:

A weather station
A smart fridge
Motion-activated lights
A remotely activated garbage door
A smart thermostat
